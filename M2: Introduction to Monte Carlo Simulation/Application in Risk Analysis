# A firm is considering producing and selling a new product
# under a pure/perfect competition market, and the firm wants
# to know the probability distribution for the profit associated
# with this product.
# The equation gives the total profit:
#   𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 = (𝑄𝑄 ∗ 𝑃𝑃) − (𝑄𝑄 ∗ 𝑣𝑣 + 𝐹𝐹)
# Where:
#   • 𝑄𝑄 is the quantity sold
# • 𝑣𝑣 is the variable cost per unit
# • 𝑃𝑃 is the sales price per unit
# • 𝐹𝐹 is the fixed cost for producing the product
# For this product, Q, P, and V are random variables with the
# following distributions:
#   • 𝑄𝑄: uniform (8000, 12000)
# • 𝑃𝑃: normal(mean = 10, sd = 3) truncated on the “left” at 1.0
# • 𝑣𝑣: normal(mean = 7, sd = 2) truncated on the “left” at 3.5
# and on the “right” at 10
# • F is estimated to be 5000.
# Want to use Monte Carlo simulation to characterize the
# distribution of total profit for the proposed product.
# Is it a cost-benefit business?

# Risk of zero or negative profit:

# Example: Expected Profit Risk Analysis
# What if we do not know the exact value for the fixed cost?
#   We ask our experts about the minimum, maximum, and the
# most likely possible option for the fixed cost; then, we form a
# Triangular distribution for the fixed cost value in our simulation.
# Here, we assume the fixed cost has a triangular distribution
# with a minimum of $4500, a maximum of $6000, and the most likely value of $5000.
# Other parameters are similar to the previous example.
