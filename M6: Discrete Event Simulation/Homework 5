## Problem 1 

# Part A 
A discrete event simulation model is created using to simulate a customer service call center with one queue and two operators. The distributions provided for customer arrival and service time were used in the model creation. The simulation is replicated 50 times. 

The mean wait time for a customer in this system is approximately 1.126 minutes. The histogram of the customer wait times shows that the majority of the customers have less than a 10 minute wait. The 95% confidence interval has lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of approximately 10.5 minutes.

```{r}
# load necessary packages
library(simmer)
library(simmer.plot)
library(triangle)

# Set the seed
set.seed(123)

# Create discrete event simulation with 2 operators and a single queue.
envs <- lapply(1:50, function(i) {
env <- simmer("Customer Service")

# Setup trajectory of customer
customer <- trajectory("customer's path") %>% 
  seize("operator", 1) %>% 
  timeout(function() rtriangle(1, a = 5, b = 20, c = 10)) %>% 
  release("operator", 1)

env %>% 
  add_resource("operator", 2) %>% 
  add_generator("customer", customer, function() rexp(1, 1/14), mon = 2)

env %>% 
  run(360)
})

# Plot the customer's path
plot(customer, verbose = T)

x1 <- get_mon_arrivals(envs)

waitTime <- (x1$end_time - x1$start_time) - x1$activity_time

mean(waitTime, na.rm = T)
quantile(waitTime, c(0.025, 0.975))

hist(waitTime, main = "Customer Wait Time", xlab = "Time (Min.)")
abline(v = 1.126063, col = "blue")
abline(v = -2.131628e-14, col = "red")
abline(v = 1.052215e+01, col = "red")
legend("topright", c("Mean", "95% Confidence Bounds"),col=c("blue", "red"), lty = 1:2, cex=0.5)
```

b) There are two operators, and each operator has its own queue. Phone calls will be
directed to the random queue (policy = “random”). Report the histogram and mean for
the average waiting time.
c) Compare the average waiting time of parts a and b. Is there any meaningful difference?
Explain.
