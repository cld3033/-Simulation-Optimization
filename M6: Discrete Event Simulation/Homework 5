# Problem 1 

## Part A 
A discrete event simulation model is created using to simulate a customer service call center with one queue and two operators. The distributions provided for customer arrival and service time were used in the model creation. The simulation is replicated 50 times. 

The mean wait time for a customer in this system is approximately 1.126 minutes. The histogram of the customer wait times shows that the majority of the customers have less than a 10 minute wait. The 95% confidence interval has lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of approximately 10.5 minutes.

```{r}
# load necessary packages
library(simmer)
library(simmer.plot)
library(triangle)

# Set the seed
set.seed(123)

# Create discrete event simulation with 2 operators and a single queue.
envs <- lapply(1:50, function(i) {
env <- simmer("Customer Service")

# Setup trajectory of customer
customer <- trajectory("customer's path") %>% 
  seize("operator", 1) %>% 
  timeout(function() rtriangle(1, a = 5, b = 20, c = 10)) %>% 
  release("operator", 1)

env %>% 
  add_resource("operator", 2) %>% 
  add_generator("customer", customer, function() rexp(1, 1/14), mon = 2)

env %>% 
  run(360)
})

# Plot the customer's path
#plot(customer, verbose = T)

x1 <- get_mon_arrivals(envs)

waitTime <- (x1$end_time - x1$start_time) - x1$activity_time

mean(waitTime, na.rm = T)
quantile(waitTime, c(0.025, 0.975))
max(waitTime)

hist(waitTime, main = "Customer Wait Time", xlab = "Time (Min.)")
abline(v = 1.126063, col = "blue")
abline(v = -2.131628e-14, col = "red")
abline(v = 1.052215e+01, col = "red")
legend("topright", c("Mean", "95% Confidence Bounds"),col=c("blue", "red"), lty = 1:2, cex=0.5)
```


## Part B 

The system is now modified to where each operator has a separate queue. The mean customer wait time after 50 simulations is approximately 4.11 minutes. The 95% confidence interval has low bound of approximately 0 and an upper bound of approximately 25.47 minutes. It can also be seen in the histogram of the wait time that the distribution is much more tailed than the system with the single queue.

```{r}
# load necessary packages
library(simmer)
library(simmer.plot)
library(triangle)

# Set the seed
set.seed(123)

# Create discrete event simulation with 2 operators and a single queue.
envs <- lapply(1:50, function(i) {
env <- simmer("Customer Service")

# Setup trajectory of customer
customer <- trajectory("customer's path") %>% 
  select(c("operator1", "operator2"), policy = "random")  %>%
  seize_selected() %>% 
  timeout(function() rtriangle(1, a = 5, b = 20, c = 10)) %>% 
  release_selected()

env %>% 
  add_resource("operator1", 1) %>% 
  add_resource("operator2", 1) %>% 
  add_generator("customer", customer, function() rexp(1, 1/14), mon = 2)

env %>% 
  run(360)
})

# Plot the customer's path
#plot(customer, verbose = T)

x1 <- get_mon_arrivals(envs)

waitTime <- (x1$end_time - x1$start_time) - x1$activity_time

xBar <- mean(waitTime, na.rm = T)
xBar
lowBound <- quantile(waitTime, c(0.025, 0.975))[1]
upperBound <- quantile(waitTime, c(0.025, 0.975))[2]
max(waitTime)

hist(waitTime, main = "Customer Wait Time", xlab = "Time (Min.)")
abline(v = xBar, col = "blue")
abline(v = lowBound, col = "red")
abline(v = upperBound, col = "red")
legend("topright", c("Mean", "95% Confidence Bounds"),col=c("blue", "red"), lty = 1:2, cex=0.5)
```

## Part C 

The mean customer wait time from the system with separate queues (approximately 4.11 minutes) is still within the 95% confidence bounds of the distribution of wait times from the system with only one queue (0, and approximately 10.5). However, the distribution for the system with 2 queues has a much larger 95% confidence interval and maximum wait time. This suggests that the system with 2 queues is significantly less efficient than the system with one queue.

# Problem 2 

## Part A

The system from problem 1 is modified to have 3 operators with separate queues with new specified service time probability distributions. After 50 replications a resource utilization plot constructed. This plot shows that the operators are reasonably utilized with operator 3 having a higher utilization. This is likely due to operator 3 having a longer service time, making them less efficient at turning over their customer calls. This indicates that they are on a customer service calls for a larger portion of the operational time, which is to be expected.

```{r}
library(simmer)
library(simmer.plot)
library(triangle)

# Set the seed
set.seed(123)

# Create discrete event simulation with 2 operators and a single queue.
envs <- lapply(1:50, function(i) {
env <- simmer("Customer Service")

# Setup trajectory of customer
customer <- trajectory("customer's path") %>% 
  
  branch(option = function() sample(1:3, 1, replace=T), continue = c(T,T,T),
         
         trajectory("A") %>% 
           seize("operator1", 1) %>% 
           timeout(function() runif(1, 5, 20)) %>% 
           release("operator1", 1),
         
         trajectory("B") %>% 
           seize("operator2", 1) %>% 
           timeout(function() runif(1, 5, 20)) %>% 
           release("operator2", 1),
         
         trajectory("C") %>% 
           seize("operator3", 1) %>% 
           timeout(function() rnorm(1, 15, 3)) %>% 
           release("operator3", 1)
         
         )

env %>% 
  add_resource("operator1", 1) %>% 
  add_resource("operator2", 1) %>% 
  add_resource("operator3", 1) %>%
  add_generator("customer", customer, function() rexp(1, 1/5), mon = 2)

env %>% 
  run(360)
})

resources <- get_mon_resources(envs)
plot(resources, metric = "utilization")
```

## Part B

The mean customer wait time for operators 1 and 2 are approximately 15.9 and 18.48 minutes respectively. Both of these means are reasonably close to each other, but differ slightly. Even though the service time probability distributions are the same for these operators, it is expected for there to be some difference due to the randomness of customer queue selection. Operator 3 has a mean wait time of approximately 24.76 minutes. This is impacted by the longer time it takes operator 3 to turn over customers.

```{r}
arrivals <- get_mon_arrivals(envs, per_resource = T)
waitingTime <- (arrivals$end_time - arrivals$start_time) - arrivals$activity_time
arrivals2 <- cbind(arrivals, waitingTime)

# Display mean wait time for each resource
aggregate(arrivals2$waitingTime, by = list(arrivals2$resource), FUN=mean)
```

## Part C

The 95% confidence interval for the wait time of customers serviced by operator 1 has lower bound of approximately 0 and an upper bound of approximately 63.28 minutes.

The 95% confidence interval for the wait time of customers serviced by operator 2 has lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of approximately 74.3 minutes.

The 95% confidence interval for the wait time of customers serviced by operator 3 has lower bound of approximately 0 and an upper bound of approximately 77.33 minutes.

```{r}
op1 <- (subset(arrivals2, arrivals2$resource == "operator1"))
op2 <- (subset(arrivals2, arrivals2$resource == "operator2"))
op3 <- (subset(arrivals2, arrivals2$resource == "operator3"))

# 95% confidence interval for operator 1
quantile(op1$waitingTime, c(0.025, 0.975))

# 95% confidence interval for operator 2
quantile(op2$waitingTime, c(0.025, 0.975))

# 95% confidence interval for operator 3
quantile(op3$waitingTime, c(0.025, 0.975))
```
