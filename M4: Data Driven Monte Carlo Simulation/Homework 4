# Problem 1

## Part A

recommend an input distribution model for the "FailCount," "RepairTime," and "DriveTime" variables. Also, determine the distributions' parameters (For example, if data is Normal, what is the approximate mean and stdev; or if the data is Uniform, what are the minimum and maximum parameters).

```{r}
# load the data
git <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cld3033/"
path <- "-Simulation-Optimization/main/M4%3A%20Data%20Driven%20Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation/"
file <- "windTurbineData(3).csv"
turbine <- read.csv(paste0(git, path, file))


######## failure count input analysis ###############

# 1. Determine if the data is discrete or continuous
turbine$failure.count # data appears to be discrete

# 2. Visualize the data 
hist(turbine$failure.count, main = "Historical Failure Count") # The distribution has a positive skew and appears to be unimodal

plot(turbine$failure.count, type = "b", main = "Historical Failure Count", 
     ylab = "Count", xlab = "Year")
# The data appears to be random in the time series plot
# The data points are independent of each other 

acf(turbine$failure.count, main = "ACF Plot for Turbine Failures") 
# lag 5 is out of the confidence band. However, the correlation is still very low.
# This suggests that the data does not have correlation with itself.

# 3. Hypothesize the distribution
library(fitdistrplus)
descdist(turbine$failure.count, discrete = TRUE)
# Poisson appears to be closest, but normal also is very close.

failFit.pois <- fitdist(turbine$failure.count, "pois")
summary(failFit.pois)
gofstat(failFit.pois)
# Fail to reject the null hypothesis that this is a good dist.

failFit.norm <- fitdist(turbine$failure.count, "norm")
summary(failFit.norm)
g <- gofstat(failFit.norm)
g$chisqpvalue
# reject the hypothesis that normal distribution is a good fit 

plot(failFit.norm)
plot(failFit.pois)
# Poisson distribution will be best for failure Count

######## repair time input analysis ###############

# 1. Determine if the data is discrete or continuous
turbine$rapair.time # data appears to be continuous

# 2. Visualize the data
hist(turbine$rapair.time, main = "Historical Repair Time")
# The data appears to have a normal distribution

plot(turbine$rapair.time, type = "b", main = "Historical Repair Time", 
     ylab = "Count", xlab = "Year") # There does not appear to be a pattern

acf(turbine$rapair.time, main = "ACF Plot for Repair Time")
# All lags are within the confidence band. The data is stationary and is uncorrelated
# with itself.

# 3. Hypothesize the distribution
descdist(turbine$rapair.time, discrete = TRUE)
# normal distribution appears to be closest, but I will try Poisson just in case.
